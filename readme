Steps to perform ab testing
- Confirm the metric, the matric has to be a quantitative measure
- Finalize the feature to test
- Design the test, significance, power, minimum desired effect
- Calculate the min size/traffic
- When to end the test
- Make decisions. e.g if the change required some comple engineering which brings risk


What is bayesian testing
- In contract to traditional approach, it assumes the metric(e.g. conversion rate) is random variable
  that has certain distribution
- By calculating the posterior distribution of control and test group, we can answer questions like
  'what is the prob of CTR in the test group is larger than the control group?'
- conjugate prior of bonulli dist
- when to exit the test - when expected loss for a variant is smaller than certain threshhould

  
Advantage of bayesian testing
- Traditional t test sometimes ignores the power/sesitivty of the test. For tranditional test, usually 
  need to large sample size to achive satisfactory power, especially you expect the affect is small
- Bayesian is more willing to accpet variants that provide small improvement
